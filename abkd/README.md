## Natural Language Tasks

Please make sure you are in the `distillation_llm` directory:

```
cd distillation_llm
```

### Installing Requirements

```
conda create -n distillm python=3.8.10
conda activate distillm
bash install.sh
```

Our code is based on [this commit](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/commit/85fde09c97213bf7e8625f83096bb2a9e183f987) of HuggingFace Transformers **by following DISTILLM**.


### Data
#### Resources
+ The training/evaluation intruction-response data before processing can be downloaded from MiniLLM [link](https://github.com/microsoft/LMOps/tree/main/minillm).
+ The plain-text corpus $\mathcal{D}_\text{PT}$ can be download from the HugginFace datasets [repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openwebtext).


#### Data Processing

SFT data

```
bash scripts/gpt2/tools/process_data_dolly.sh /PATH_TO/LMOps/minillm # Process Dolly Train / Validation Data
bash scripts/openllama2/tools/process_data_dolly.sh /PATH_TO/LMOps/minillm # Process Dolly Train / Validation Data
```

Get plain-text corpus $\mathcal{D}_\text{PT}$:
```bash
python3 tools/get_openwebtext.py
```
This script will replace the continuous `\n` in each document with a special token "<@x(x!>" and write each document in OpenWebText in a line, which is convenient for parallel processing. In `data/openwebtext/data.txt`, we give an example of the resulting format. You can follow this format to prepare other corpus beyond OpenWebText.

Tokenize the data and store them in binary files:
```bash
bash scripts/gpt2/tools/process_data_dolly.sh ${/PATH/TO/ABKD} ${MASTER_PORT} ${GPU_NUM} # Process Dolly Train / Validation Data
bash scripts/gpt2/tools/process_data_pretrain.sh ${/PATH/TO/ABKD} ${MASTER_PORT} ${GPU_NUM} # Process OpenWebText Train / Validation Data

bash scripts/llama/tools/process_data_dolly.sh ${/PATH/TO/ABKD} ${MASTER_PORT} ${GPU_NUM} # Process Dolly Train / Validation Data
bash scripts/llama/tools/process_data_pretrain.sh ${/PATH/TO/ABKD} ${MASTER_PORT} ${GPU_NUM} # Process OpenWebText Corpus Train / Validation Data
```

### Base Pre-trained Models
To run fine-tuning or standard KD baselines, you need to download the model checkpoints from [Huggingface Model Hub] and put them in `checkpoints/`. For example, for gpt2-large, you can download the model from this [link](https://huggingface.co/gpt2-large/tree/main) and put them in `checkpoints/gpt2-large`.

Alternatively, you can also change the `CKPT` variable in each script to the corresponding model name to enable Transformers to download the base models automatically. For example, set `CKPT="gpt2-large"` in `scripts/gpt2/sft/sft_large.sh` causes download of the gpt2-large base model from the HugginFace model hub.

### Train
We provide example commands for GPT-2 models. Similar scripts for model families can be found in `scripts/openllama2`. All our experiments are conducted on 4~8 RTX 3090 24GB GPUs.

#### Baselines
The final checkpoints are selected by the **ROUGE-L** scores.

##### Fine-tune the teacher models
```bash
bash scripts/gpt2/sft/sft_xlarge.sh ${/PATH/TO/ABKD} ${MASTER_PORT} ${GPU_NUM}
```
##### SFT Baselines
```bash
bash scripts/gpt2/sft/sft_base.sh ${/PATH/TO/ABKD} ${MASTER_PORT} ${GPU_NUM}
```

##### KD Baselines
```bash
bash scripts/gpt2/kd/kd_base.sh ${/PATH/TO/ABKD} ${MASTER_PORT} ${GPU_NUM}
```

##### SeqKD Baselines
Generate and process responses with the teacher:
```bash
bash scripts/gpt2/tools/generate_data_seqkd.sh ${/PATH/TO/ABKD} ${MASTER_PORT} ${GPU_NUM}
bash scripts/gpt2/tools/process_pseudo_data_seqkd.sh ${/PATH/TO/ABKD} ${MASTER_PORT} ${GPU_NUM}
```
Fine-tune the model with SeqKD:
```bash
bash scripts/gpt2/seqkd/seqkd_base.sh ${/PATH/TO/ABKD} ${MASTER_PORT} ${GPU_NUM}
bash scripts/gpt2/seqkd/seqkd_medium.sh ${/PATH/TO/ABKD} ${MASTER_PORT} ${GPU_NUM}
bash scripts/gpt2/seqkd/seqkd_large.sh ${/PATH/TO/ABKD} ${MASTER_PORT} ${GPU_NUM}
```

##### Student Initialization
The final checkpoints are selected by the **validation loss**.
```bash
bash scripts/gpt2/init/init_base.sh ${/PATH/TO/ABKD} ${MASTER_PORT} ${GPU_NUM}
```

##### MiniLLM Baselines

Please refer to the original [MiniLLM repository](https://github.com/microsoft/LMOps/tree/main/minillm) for detailed implementation.

##### GKD Baselines
```bash
bash scripts/gpt2/gkd/gkd_base_xl.sh ${/PATH/TO/ABKD} ${MASTER_PORT} ${GPU_NUM}
```

##### DistiLLM Baselines
```bash
bash scripts/gpt2/distillm/train_0.1B_1.5B.sh ${/PATH/TO/ABKD} ${MASTER_PORT} ${GPU_NUM}
```

#### ABKD (Ours)
```bash
bash scripts/gpt2/ab/train_0.1B_1.5B.sh ${/PATH/TO/ABKD} ${MASTER_PORT} ${GPU_NUM}
```

### Run Evaluation
```bash
bash scripts/gpt2/eval/run_eval.sh ${GPU_IDX} ${/PATH/TO/ABKD}
```


## Standard Classification Task

Please make sure you are in the `standard_classification` directory:

```
cd standard_classification
```

Fetch the pretrained teacher models by:
```
bash scripts/fetch_pretrained_teachers.sh
```
which will download and save the models to `save/models`

### Running

- To run vanilla KD:
```
bash train_kd.sh 
```
- To calibrate the loss function used in vanilla KD and obtain our proposed **ABKD**:
```
bash train_ab.sh 
  1.1 \  # start_alpha_beta: Starting value of (alpha + beta)
  1.1 \  # end_alpha_beta: Ending value of (alpha + beta)
  0.8 \   # start_alpha
  0.8 \   # end_alpha
  resnet56 \   # teacher_model
  resnet20 \   # student_model
  0 \   # gpu_id
  32    # b (weight for distillation loss)
```
  
- To run other baselines (e.g., LSD):
```
bash train_ls.sh 1.0 1.0 0 0 resnet56 resnet20 \
  0 # gpu id
```

- To calibrate the loss function of LSD and obtain ABLSD:
```
bash train_ls.sh 1.2 1.2 0.9 0.9 resnet56 resnet20 0
```

The resulting log file of an experiment recording test accuracy after each epoch is saved in './save'.

## Base to New Classification Task

Please make sure you are in the  `base_to_new_classification` directory:
```
cd base_to_new_classification
```
